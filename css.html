    <h1>Chandrayaan-3: India's Leap to the Moon</h1>

    <p>
        As an <span class="highlight">Indian space enthusiast</span>, Chandrayaan-3 marked one of the most emotional and glorious milestones in ISRO's history. 
        After the heartbreak of Chandrayaan-2’s soft landing failure, the nation stood behind our scientists. And in 2023, we rose again — this time not just aiming for the moon, but making history by becoming the first nation to land near the Moon’s south pole.
    </p>

    <h2>A Journey of Persistence</h2>

    <p>
        The Chandrayaan-3 mission was built not just on technology but on <span class="highlight">resilience, learning, and courage</span>. ISRO's team took lessons from past failures and turned them into a success story that inspired a billion dreams.
        It was a story not just of science, but of belief — the belief that India can lead in space exploration.
    </p>

    <p>
        The world watched in awe as Vikram Lander made a perfect soft landing on lunar soil. From school kids to scientists, the mission sparked pride across every Indian heart.
    </p>

    <h2>The Heroes Behind the Mission</h2>

    <p>
        Chandrayaan-3 was a collective effort led by some brilliant minds in ISRO, including <span class="highlight">S. Somanath</span>, the ISRO Chairman. 
        The mission saw contributions from thousands of scientists, engineers, technicians, and students. 
        It was not just their knowledge but their emotional strength that helped India take this giant leap.
    </p>

    <p>
        From powering new propulsion systems to developing cutting-edge AI-based analysis tools, the mission represented India’s self-reliance in space tech.
    </p>

    <h2>Why It Mattered</h2>

    <p>
        Chandrayaan-3 was more than a moon mission — it was a statement to the world. It showed what India can do with limited resources, unmatched spirit, and a unified vision. 
        It proved that success isn’t always about competition, but about perseverance and learning from failure.

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

    <p>
        As a citizen, witnessing this moment was nothing short of emotional. It reminded me that when we believe in our dreams and work with consistency and dedication, the universe is within reach. 
        Chandrayaan-3 wasn't just a win for ISRO — it was a victory for every Indian.
